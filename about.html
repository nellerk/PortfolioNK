        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello World! My name is Kristof Neller, a soon to be Full-Stack Developer from Szeged. Currently, I'm learning in an afterschool, between High-School and University. Once I finished where I'm studying currently, I plan to move to University, to increase my knowledge in IT, as I think it's the future. I've studied IT and Programming since High-School, I even have a graduation about it, in the Basic Level. It's important to keep up with the updates and new inventions, as they make one's life easier, and those may have opportunity for a nice, enjoyable job as a reward for your studies. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, watching movies or series, or even playing computer games, when I'm really bored. My hobby is doing Martial Arts, and I can say I have exceeded my imagination while doing so.
